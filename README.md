# Yolo_object_detection

Yolov3 algorithm was used to detect objects. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm that can identify objects in an image and provide their locations, sizes, and classes in real-time. YOLO uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in a single evaluation.
